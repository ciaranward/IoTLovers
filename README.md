This is a repository displaying the code for our project which involves a sound sensor and an LCD display monitor. 
The sound sensor connects to the LCD and displays the level of sound in the room. Underneath it displays wether the sound is low, medium or high in 
the room. 
This can be particularly useful for people with hearing impairments as they are aware of the level of the sound in the room. 
This can also be useful for music bands in hotel environments who are restricted in terms of how high they can play their music, as to not disturb guests.
